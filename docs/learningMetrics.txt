The most rewarding aspect of this program was the deep integration of classes we were able to utilize while building our program. I really enjoyed finding a methodical and logical class hierarchy that worked successfully. The achievement I felt when the final product was done was also very rewarding. The difference between having to go to office hours and completing the project is a proud moment of mine. I also loved getting the web server to work properly and seeing my code run in the browser. When displaying results in the browser (as opposed to the terminal) it seems much more professional and user focused. I was also intrigued to see how much potential this kinda of implementation can have. From this simple web server and basic HTML, you can creates something quite useful.


The most challenging aspect of this project was realizing that the inventory class is totally separate from the item class. I thought item was going to inherit inventory, but I finally realized that inventory is more like an ADT and item is more like a data organizer. I also found it challenging to organize and comment my code because I left all my commenting to the end. Going forward, I will comment as I code to save time at the end. It was also difficult determining what functions I had to change and which ones should remain untouched. There wasn't much to actually code, but understanding the code was crucial before trying to jump right in. I also had difficulty implementing my search_inventory function, which was a result of a careless typo. Being more careful while I code will make the entire process more efficient and mitigate mistakes.
