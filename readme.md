## Inventory Web Server 

The goal of this project is to develop a simple web server and interface where users can track inventory of a store, library, etc. Core computer science concepts utilized in this project include: classes & inheritance, HTML forms, HTTP communication with a local host, and CSV file data extraction.

In order to run my simple web server and see my sample inventory, simple run the file "webServer.py" in the project's parent directory. Then open any web browser (I used Chrome during development) and navigate to "http://localhost:8080/". There you will find instructions to interact with my program. Happy searching!
